# Pizza-Restaurant-Vuex
>This is a Vuex Made CRUD project.This website uses one the main property of vue which is its state management library called VUEX. Also i have used the reusable components to increase the load on the website. In this Website you can order pizza and it will calculate price for you. The data will be stored in firebase. Most important and heavily made section of this website is admin section. In this section you can add/remove items in the menu. You can check the orders and cancel them. To access admin you need user login authentication which is made using firebase.

## Link to my website is:

### Note
